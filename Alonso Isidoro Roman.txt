Alonso Isidoro Roman.txt
I am a software engineer with 20 years of experience, graduated from the CÃ¡ceres Polytechnic, in Spain, with many more credits than necessary. I have always really liked working with machines, since I was little when I had access to a 128KB tape spectrum. I took my first steps programming with it. Later at university I distinguished myself among my classmates by helping them as much as I could with their programming tasks. There I learned c, c++, assembler, pascal, java, linux, sql, database management systems, a lot of mathematics subjects, as well as subjects such as creating compilers, distributed databases, concurrent systems and networks. I had access to my first experiences in cybersecurity.
My first professional jobs were related to the web, especially with the backend layer and application servers, with J2EE applications created with frameworks such as struts and a little later Spring. Years later I discovered the existence of distributed clusters with Hadoop and Spark, as well as messaging brokers such as ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ and Kafka.

I have worked for many years with this technology, reaching technical responsibilities such as back-end software architecture and Big data, along with the management of CI/CD pipelines through Jenkins, Git, Ansible, GitHub Actions, SonarQube. During this time I rediscovered my passion for cybersecurity and pentesting, as well as the need to research tools to protect infrastructure in production.
I am currently researching the field of LLMs and everything around them such as RAG, building in my time a python tool for cybersecurity practitioners, which deals with using an LLM and different cybersecurity tools, as well as the possibility of being able to install new tools and interact with the LLM, so that little by little the LLM can learn from experience by storing the experience in a vector database.
